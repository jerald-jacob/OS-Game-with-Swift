# OS-Game-with-Swift
The iOS game we’e going to create is called “Add 1”. It’s inspired by Daniel Kahneman, a renowned psychologist and economist, and author of Thinking, Fast And Slow. Kahneman used a game, that lets people “add 1” to an arbitrary sequence of numbers, to test a concept called cognitive strain.  The goal of the game we’re building is to “add one” to each of the numbers of a 4-digit sequence, as many times as you can in 60 seconds. You get one point for each correct answer. How many points can you score?
