# iOS-Game-with-Swift
The iOS game we’e going to create is called “Add 1”. It’s inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman">Daniel Kahneman</a>, a renowned psychologist and economist, and author of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow">Thinking, Fast And Slow.</a> Kahneman used a game, that lets people “add 1” to an arbitrary sequence of numbers, to test a concept called cognitive strain.  The goal of the game we’re building is to “add one” to each of the numbers of a 4-digit sequence, as many times as you can in 60 seconds. You get one point for each correct answer. How many points can you score?
